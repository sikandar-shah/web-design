        <p>Renowned type designer, Matthew Carter, has this to say about his
      profession:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Our alphabet hasn't changed in eons; there isn't much latitude in
      what a designer can do with the individual letters.
      Much like a piece of classical music, the score is written
      down. It's not something that is tampered with, and yet, each
      conductor interprets that score differently. There is tension in
      the interpretation.</p>
