# Web Design and Development


> easy, to follow tutorials for helping student to get from novice level to expert level.

[HTML,CSS & Javascript](https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp) are the big three. They allow you to design and develop web sites, *statically*.

In order to run static web sites, there is no need for fancy web servers and stuff. You have already go what you need, a computer, some enthusiasm and this resource for getting you through the practise sessions of the coding process. 
```

What you need is :

1. a text editor. notepad works and so does notepad++, atom, sublime, etc.
2. a browser which can be chrome, edge, firefox, safari etc.
3. you need to know syntax of HTML, CSS to create the presentation part or the front end.
4. various books are followed and will be mentioned explicitly if anyone is interested.
5. need to follow conventions/standards set by w3c.


For better results, you need to do the following.

1. put in extra time and effort.
2. In start, use a simple text editor for all exercises and activities and nothing else.
3. practise till you can't get it wrong.
4. There are validators which we mention as we go through the lesson that let you check 
   the problem with your code.

# Practise and Activities
## Heading Tags
 In order to practice heading tags that are of 6 types of the format hx (where x can be from 1 to 6). h1 being the largest and h6 being the smallest. This tag is written as a pair meaning that it has an opening and closing tag. Click [Heading tags practice](https://github.com/sikandar-shah/web-design/blob/HTML/exercise1.html) 
***
## Hyperlink Tag
In order to understand hyperlinks, you need two pages to demonstrate the concept. Obviously you need to create a hyperlink on one page that links to another page. For this activity, we have two pages, firstpage.html and secondpage.html. Practising this activity will show you how to navigate from one page to another.

[second page](https://github.com/sikandar-shah/web-design/blob/HTML/secondpage.html)
***
## Paragraph and Empty Tag
This activity will delve in showing paragragh tag and one empty tag. Line break is used for marking a new section and it HTML an empty tag called <br> is used. In this example same content as used in Hyperlink Tag example is used. Other empty tags are image, input, link, meta and hr etc. These will be covered in seperate activity.

## Formatting tags
This activity demonstrates formatting tags and you can easily use this content to change formatting for yourself accordingly. There are many tags and the best way to find out how to format your content is write some lines in word and highlight some text, underline others and do similar stuff to the remaining. Try to match your html content to the output of word document. Its a really fun way to practise and learn.

***
## Nested tags
This activity demonstrates nested tags and you can easily use this content to see how nested tags work. The tags that are nested inside should have opening and closing tags in pairs. for example in <head> we write opening tag <title> inside it and then closing title before closing head. It cant be such that you close head before closing title. There is a hiearchial order.

## Comments in HTML
This activity will enable you to learn about comments. single line and multiline comments are sometimes needed for debugging purposes. The coder also can save hints in comments in HTML.

***
## Attributes in HTML
This activity demonstrates use of attributes for HTML tags. Every tag has one or more attributes. In this section we show how to use attributes to effectively use tags.

***
## Inline vs Block Elements
This activity shows difference between block and inline elements. In previous versions heading and paragraph tags would display on same line but in html 5 they are displayed on seperate lines. A tag that is displayed on another new line is called block element. A tag that is displayed on same line after or before other html elements is called inline element.

[Block tag](https://github.com/sikandar-shah/web-design/blob/HTML/block.html)
***
## Description List
The dl element is allowed to contain only dt and dd elements. You cannot put headings or content-grouping elements (like paragraphs) in names (dt), but the value (dd) can contain any type of flow content. For example, the last dd element in the example contains two paragraph elements. It is permitted to have multiple definitions with one term and vice versa. Here,
each term-description group has one term and multiple definitions:
```  
   <dl>
      <dt>Shapes</dt>
      <dd>Circle</dd>
      <dd>Square</dd>
      <dt>Dogs</dt>
      <dd>German Sheperd</dd>
      <dd>Doberman</dd>
      <dd>Poodle</dd>
   </dl>
   ```

## Preformatted Tag
This tag is very useful if you wanted to show code or poems or any content that should be dispalyed as is. What this means is this tag includes all whitespaces and carriage returns in the content and the text is meant to be displayed with all these details.

## Image Tag
This tag is very useful if you want to embed some images in your document. Image tag has many attributes. Here alt attribute is used in which we specify name of the image. If image is not present then the text in specified in the alt attribute is shown. src is a required attribute in which the relative path can be specified for the image that you need to load or embed in the browser.
