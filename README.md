[HTML,CSS & Javascript](https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp) are the big three. They allow you to design and develop web sites, *statically*.

In order to run static web sites, there is no need for fancy web servers and stuff. You have already go what you need, a computer, some enthusiasm and this resource for getting you through the practise sessions of the coding process.

What you need is :

1. a text editor. notepad works and so does notepad++, atom, sublime, etc.
2. a browser which can be chrome, edge, firefox, safari etc.
3. you need to know syntax of HTML, CSS to create the presentation part or the front end.
4. various books are followed and will be mentioned explicitly if anyone is interested.
5. need to follow conventions/standards set by w3c.


For better results, you need to do the following.

1. put in extra time and effort.
2. In start, use a simple text editor for all exercises and activities and nothing else.
3. practise till you can't get it wrong.
4. There are validators which we mention as we go through the lesson that let you check 
   the problem with your code.
