      By default(border-style:none) the margin for paragraoh is 16 top and 16 bottom. while left and right margin along
      with all padding and border are set to zero.
      When i inspected the empahsis tag, which is an inline tag, it had border, padding and margin
      all set to zero.

      When border-style changed to another then default: all margin becomes 3 and margnin top and bottom are 16.
