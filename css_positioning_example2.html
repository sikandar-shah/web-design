The	absence	of	romance	in	my	history	will,	I	fear,	detract somewhat
from	its	interest;	but	if	it	be	judged	useful	by	those	inquirers who
desire	an	exact	knowledge	of	the	past	as	an	aid	to	the interpretation
of	the	future,	which	in	the	course	of	human	things	must	resemble if it
does	not	reflect	it,	I	shall	be	content.
